	* Version 1.7.3
	* Interactive commands now treat files smaller than minsize consistent
	    with scan and report behavior (github bug #47).

2023-05-21  Jyri J. Virkki  <jyri@virkki.com>
	* Version 1.7.2
	* (Backport from 2.0-dev) Allow path list to be larger than 64K files.
	* (Backport from 2.0-dev) Silence false positive warning by increasing buffer
	* Add some commentary in the manpage on database staleness.
	* Make the uniques operation more efficient if scan done with --uniques.

2021-08-22  Jyri J. Virkki  <jyri@virkki.com>
	* Version 1.7.1
	* (Backport from 2.0-dev) Fix in include file.
	* (Backport from 2.0-dev) Use file with awk instead of -e option.

2018-07-18  Jyri J. Virkki  <jyri@virkki.com>

	* Version 1.7
	* Add --one-file-system option.
	* Removed SSD scan implementation.
	    This is unfortunate as it is faster than the HDD scan in some
	    scenarios. However, it can also be much slower. More importantly,
	    keeping both was becoming too much of a maintenance burden.
	* Deprecated several options. These are likely to be removed in 2.0:
	    --cmp-three
	    --hdd
	    --ssd
	    --skip-two
	    --skip-three
	* Test cleanup
	    Ignore tests which fail as root if run as root.
	    Clean tmp files from another test (in case it had failed).
	* Updated included xxhash.
	* Some stats cleanup, not enough.
	* Revive 32 bit support (github #21).
	* Statically regenerate embedded man page (github #18).
	* Try for a more universal cleanup in test.49 (github #19).
	* For release builds, set GITHASH to the release instead.

2018-03-21  Jyri J. Virkki  <jyri@virkki.com>

	* Version 1.6
	* Made --hdd mode the default.
	* Added an --ssd option to select SSD mode.
	* Added xxHash as an hash function and made it the default.
	* --hardlink-is-unique no longer forces --hdd mode.
	* Support for limiting read buffer allocation during scan.
	* Allow setting verbosity level directly with -V.
	* Deprecated the --uniques option, it hasn't been useful.
	* Deprecated the --nodb option, it goes against the dupd way.
	* Deprecated the --intblocks option, no longer relevant.
	* Deprecated the --file-count option, not needed.
	* Various performance improvements.
	* Minor stats and reporting cleanup.
	* Add support for building on FreeBSD.
	* Although not user-visible (ideally), this release contains
	  substantial code refactoring of several subsystems. Test carefully.

2017-12-12  Jyri J. Virkki  <jyri@virkki.com>

	* Version 1.5
